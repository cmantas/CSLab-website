        TOPICS FOR DIPLOMA THESIS<br>
        (INDEPENDENT STUDIES) </b></font></p>
        <p align="right"><b>by George Economakos<br>
        Electrical Engineer NTUA<br>
        currently a PhD Student at NTUA</b></p>
        <p>The Digital Systems and Computers Laboratory suggests
        for the current academic season 1996 - 1997 the following
        student project topics:<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Automated Synthesis of Computer Architectures </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One position in the field of high-level synthesis
                for the development of a behavioral into
                structural (structural VHDL preferred)
                description translator, using generalized
                building blocks (adders, registers, buses, i.e.
                register transfer level building blocks), based
                on attribute grammars. The project has two main
                goals. The first is the formal description of the
                major synthesis algorithms (scheduling,
                allocation) using attribute grammars. The second
                is the selection and exploitment of the most
                suitable attribute grammar evaluator. <br>
            </li>
            <li>One position in the field of high-level synthesis
                for the synthesis of structural descriptions with
                generalized building blocks (register transfer
                level) using CAD tools such as Alliance, Cadence,
                WorkView PLUS. The descriptions will be in VHDL
                and the first example descriptions will be the
                benchmarks of the 1992 High Level Synthesis
                Workshop. Next, the output descriptions from the
                above project will be used, in an effort to
                construct an integrated and generalized
                high-level synthesis environment. <br>
            </li>
            <li>One position in the field of logic minimization
                for the exact or at least optimal AND-XOR
                minimization without formalization or polarity
                constrains. This is a hard research activity and
                so there are no development environment
                limitations (MS-DOS or UNIX and any suitable
                programming language, according to the student's
                experience). Since the exact solution is a hard
                problem, ESPRESSO like heuristics (widely used
                AND-OR minimizer) can be used in the worst case.
                Two and multi level cases will be studied. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Generalized Telemedicine Applications </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Two one year positions for the development of a
                general purpose digital signal processing
                platform, focusing on telemedicine applications.
                The development environment will be Windows 3.x
                and the programming language Visual C++ Version
                1.51 (or greater). The basic services the
                platform will support are: <ul>
                    <li>Connection with a recording instrument
                        for digital signal acquisition using as
                        an example serial communications. </li>
                    <li>Signal preprocessing (compression,
                        waveform interpretation, extraction of
                        basic characteristics). </li>
                    <li>On screen signal presentation using an
                        appropriate scale. </li>
                    <li>Printing of characteristic snapshots. </li>
                    <li>Implementation of a generalized data
                        base. </li>
                    <li>Communication with remote hosts using TCP
                        and UDP packet protocols. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The students who will work for this project
                must be very efficient with the specification of
                the functional requirements of the platform and
                the extensive design phase, in an effort to
                develop a highly flexible laboratory prototype
                which will support the development of many
                specialized related applications. In case more
                students are interested, the two students can be
                enforced by another two who will follow all of
                the development phases and port the platform,
                after it is finished, on Windows 95 using Visual
                C++ Version 4.0 (or greater). <br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>One position for the maintenance and extension of
                the generalized ECG handling telemedicine
                platform of D.S.C. Lab (in case more students are
                interested, a second can also get involved or the
                project can be split into more independent
                sub-projects). The development environment will
                be MS-DOS and the programming language Borland
                C++ Version 2.0 (or greater).The basic extensions
                to the platform will be: <ul>
                    <li>Development of a serial device driver for
                        the 16550AFN UART chip. </li>
                    <li>Connection with an analog ECG recorder
                        using an A/D PC card (continue a
                        preexisting project) and possible design
                        of a simple analog amplifier. </li>
                    <li>Development of printer device drivers for
                        laser printers (the dot-matrix case has
                        been implemented). </li>
                    <li>Modification of all existing code and
                        translation from C to C++ using
                        object-oriented design to obtain greater
                        upgradeability. </li>
                    <li>Communication with remote hosts using TCP
                        and UDP packet protocols. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project has the advantage that a lot of
                resources are available (software and books).
                Special care will be taken for the documentation
                of the project which is the expansion of an
                innovative activity of D.S.C. Lab with many
                practical applications. There will be many
                opportunities for cooperation with the above
                project's team. <br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>One position for the development of a computer
                simulator for the CRITIKON (Johnson &amp; Johnson
                Medical Inc.) DINAMAP PLUS biosignals (ECG, blood
                pressure, temperature, heart rate) monitor. The
                development environment will be MS-DOS and the
                programming language any version of C, with a
                preference in Borland C++ Version 2.0 or 3.0 (in
                order to make extended use of the existing serial
                communication libraries). The simulator is
                required to work in real time, that is to
                transmit data in the same rate as the monitor,
                which is the 200Hz sampling rate. The simulator
                must implement as many as possible of the
                commands that compose the special communication
                protocol of the PLUS. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Computer Architecture </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One position for the development of a computer
                simulator for the TRN training microcomputer,
                presented for educational purposes to the
                students who attend the course of Computer
                Architecture, under Windows. The simulator will
                gradually replace the older MS-DOS version
                presently provided to the students. The main goal
                of this project is the development of a new user
                friendly and more stimulating student assistant
                which will take full advantage of what new
                information technology has to offer. The
                development will be performed using either Visual
                C++, or Multimedia Toolbook. <br>
            </li>
